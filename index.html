            <h1 class="header">Low Level Pie Charts</h1>
            <p>
                I was recently asked how one might go about creating a pie
                chart using standard html and css and it occurred to me that
                while I have done a ton of these charts on both the client
                and server using various graphing libraries, I never had the
                need to try to directly render one myself.  So for fun
                I took a look at what it takes to do this -- here are a
                couple of examples of pie charts using SVG and the canvas
                API from some simple JSON data.

        <h1 class="header">Using SVG</h1>
          <p>
              Using SVGs to render a pie chart appears to be pretty straight
              forward once you understand how the arc path expressions work.
              While it is a little more work to calculate the values for
              the arc expressions than in canvas, we have a lot more flexibility
              since SVGs can still make use of css and things like title elements.

              The one "gotcha" seems to be if you try to draw a full circle
              using the arc path expression it will disappear -- one work
              around is to check for a single 100% pie slice and draw a
              circle instead.

        <h1 class="header">Using Canvas</h1>
          <p>
              While the arc functions in the canvas were a little easier to
              understand and use than the SVG ones, overall using the canvas
              to render a pie chart seems to be more difficult than SVG.  While
              there is experimental support for being able to tie mouse events
              to a specific path in the canvas, it cannot be relied upon and
              you have to use quite a bit of hackery and manual work in order
              to do something simple like display a tooltip like text element
              when the user hovers over a pie slice.
